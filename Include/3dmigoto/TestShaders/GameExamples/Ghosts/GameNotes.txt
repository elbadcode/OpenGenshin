Seems like using the standard profile is working OK.

3D doesn't always engage at game launch.  alt-tab out and back in, and it starts up.

The dog fur is a special setting, and looks like it has a deferred rendering problem.
It can be set to Off in the settings, which seems fine.  Low also seems to work without glitches.

Water or grates are weird.  Double bars/mesh, that separate to distance.  Haloing of all overlap.

Crosshair is at screen depth, but if you enable Laser sight, it follows depths.
Nameplates are on same shader, as well as pause UI.

Screen Space AO set to HBA0+ makes screen white out and is bad. High works.


Can set Distortion to Off to avoid water distortion effect.

Can kill shader 49fe43057b6e203e-vs_replace.txt to resolve water reflection problems.


Might be best to just kill the sun in space.  There is a flare on the UI shader, so we can't kill
that piece.  Maybe texture map.
